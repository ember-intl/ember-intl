# Overview

## What is Ember-Intl?

Ember-intl is an ember addon for internationalization that focuses on **translating simple to complex messages** as well as **localized formatting** for date/time, number, and relative time.
Ember-intl is based on the native [ECMAScript Internationalization API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) that is now supported by [all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=internationalization).
