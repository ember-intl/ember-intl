# Quickstart

## 1. Install ember-intl

```bash
ember install ember-intl
```

This will create the following files:

* `app/formats.js`
    <!-- default definitions of named formats -->
* `config/ember-intl.js`
    <!-- default ember-intl settings -->
* `translations/en-us.yaml`

## 2. Add your first translation

Create a translation key in `translations/en-us.yaml`

```yaml
hello:
  world: Hello World!
```
In a template add the following:
```hbs
<!-- app/templates/application.hbs -->
<h1>{{t "hello.world"}}</h1>

{{outlet}}
```

## 3. Add a new language

Create a new translation file: `translations/fr-fr.yaml`

```
hello:
  world: "Bonjour tout le monde!"
```

## 4. Configure ember-intl

**Setting your applications runtime locale**

When your application boots, you want to tell ember-intl which locale it should be targeting.  One common approach, is to do this in your top-level `application` route's `beforeModel` hook.

_Note:_ This is usually implemented with custom business logic - such as read it off a User model.

```js
// app/routes/application.js
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default class ApplicationRoute extends Route {
    @service intl;

    beforeModel() {
        this.intl.setLocale(['en-us']);
    }

    model() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Configure your template linter**

If your app uses `ember-cli-template-lint` (which is installed by default since ember-cli v3.4.1),
it is strongly recommanded that you add the `no-bare-strings` rule to your template linter.
This rule will prevent you from using plain text strings in your templates (because they cannot be translated).

To enabled the template linter rule, edit the file `.template-lintrc.js` as follow:

```js
// .template-lintrc.js
'use strict';

module.exports = {
  extends: 'recommended',

  rules: {
    'no-bare-strings': true
  }
};
```
