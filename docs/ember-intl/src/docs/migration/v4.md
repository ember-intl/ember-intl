# Migration from v3 to v4

No migration necessary.


## Breaking Change

- CLDR locale data set has been updated from 28.0.0 to 34.0.0
- Legacy instance initializer removed.  Only a breaking change if you reference it in another one of your initializers using `before: 'ember-intl'` or `after: 'ember-intl'`


## Enhancements

- Translation blueprint now adds translation relative to config `inputPath` option
- Relative time API now has `short` units
- `baseLocale` API has returned as `fallbackLocale`. Enables merging the fallback locale's translations into all other locales as a build-time fallback strategy.
