# Test helpers

`ember-intl` provides a few test helpers, so that you can check locale-dependent code (e.g. component and route templates) under various conditions.

The test helper that you will most frequently use is `setupIntl()`. You may want to check the [documentation for `setupIntl()`](./setup-intl) first.
