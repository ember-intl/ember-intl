# Migration from 7.0 to 8.0

## Breaking changes

### Minimum requirements

The following versions are supported when issues arise.

- Ember 4.12 and above
- Node 20 and above
- `@ember/test-helpers` 4.x and above


### Renamed `formatRelative()` and `{{format-relative}}`

It was unclear from the name what exactly is being compared (relative to what?).

The method and the corresponding helper are called `formatRelativeTime()` and `{{format-relative-time}}` in `v8`.

```diff
// For *.{gjs,gts,js,ts} files
- this.intl.formatRelative(-1);
+ this.intl.formatRelativeTime(-1);
```

```diff
{{! For *.hbs files }}
<div>
-   Past: {{format-relative -1}}
+   Past: {{format-relative-time -1}}
</div>
```

```diff
// For *.{gjs,gts} files
- import { formatRelative } from 'ember-intl';
+ import { formatRelativeTime } from 'ember-intl';

<template>
  <div>
-     Past: {{formatRelative -1}}
+     Past: {{formatRelativeTime -1}}
  </div>
</template>
```
