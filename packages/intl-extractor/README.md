# Intl-Extractor


Bundled tool with ember-intl to automatically create translation files from a source-language.

## Usage


**CLI** (for apps)
```bash
npm exec intl-extract
```

or

**Rollup** (for libraries)


## TODO

- output format should be configurable ( message keys, translation keys, or no object entirely)
