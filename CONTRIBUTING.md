<summary>Publish packages (for admins)</summary>

1. Generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/) in GitHub, with default values for scopes (none selected).

1. Run the `release:changelog` script. This generates a text that you can add to `ember-intl/CHANGELOG.md`.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    GITHUB_AUTH=<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> pnpm release:changelog
    ```

    Update the version number in `package.json`. Then, create a commit for the file changes (i.e. `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json`).

1. [Create a tag](https://github.com/ember-intl/ember-intl/releases/new) and provide release notes. The tag name should match the package version, prefixed by the letter `v`. For example, `v1.0.0`.

1. Publish the package.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    pnpm release:publish
    ```
