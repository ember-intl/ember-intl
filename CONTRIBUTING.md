<details>

<summary>Add changeset to pull request</code></summary>

1. To record how a pull request affects packages, you will want to add a changeset.

    The changeset provides a summary of the code change. It also describes how package versions should be updated (major, minor, or patch) as a result of the code change.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    pnpm changeset
    ```

</details>


<details>

<summary>Publish packages (for admins)</summary>

1. Generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/) in GitHub. This token will be used to retrieve pull request information.

1. Run the `release:prepare` script. This removes changesets, updates package versions, and updates `CHANGELOG`s.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> pnpm release:prepare
    ```

    Note, `release:prepare` also updated the workspace root's version (e.g. from `0.1.1` to `0.1.2`). We will use it to name the tag that will be published.

1. Review the file changes. Commit them in a branch, then open a pull request to merge the changes to the `main` branch.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    git checkout -b tag-0.1.2
    git add .
    git commit -m "Tagged 0.1.2"
    git push origin tag-0.1.2
    ```

1. [Create a tag](https://github.com/ember-intl/ember-intl/releases/new) and provide release notes. The tag name should match the workspace root's version, prefixed by the letter `v` (e.g. `v0.1.2`).

1. Publish the packages.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    pnpm release:publish
    ```
