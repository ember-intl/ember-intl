## Documentation

[5.x](https://ember-intl.github.io/ember-intl/versions/master/docs/quickstart)

[4.x (legacy)](https://ember-intl.github.io/ember-intl/versions/v4.4.0/docs/quickstart)

## Migrating from 4.x to 5.x
### Notable Changes

* Polyfills have been removed entirely and with it the need to bundle the pluralization rules as they now come from the native `Intl.PluralRules` API
* Translations are now placed in a fixed location when bundled, no longer need to traverse the private API `requirejs._eak_seen` to hydrate the service with translations
* `Intl.MessageFormat` [parser](https://formatjs.io/docs/intl-messageformat-parser) and [compiler](https://formatjs.io/docs/intl-messageformat) updated which changes how text and tags are escaped

### Breaking Changes

* Node 8 support dropped
* `Intl.RelativeTime` polyfill has been replaced with the native API which behaves entirely different than the previous older spec implementation (read about in the [Migration Document](https://ember-intl.github.io/ember-intl/docs/guide/migration-4-0-to-5-0))
* Translations are now escaped differently (read about in the [Migration Document](https://ember-intl.github.io/ember-intl/docs/guide/migration-4-0-to-5-0))
* Removes `shortNumber` formatting in favor of now supported native implementation using the `"notation"` property i.e.,
```js
this.intl.formatNumber(1000, {
  notation: "compact" ,
  compactDisplay: "short"
}); // -> 1k
```

When you're ready to upgrade, head over to the [Migration Document](https://ember-intl.github.io/ember-intl/docs/guide/migration-4-0-to-5-0) to read more in detail about what changed.

All of this will result in smaller bundles, faster build times, and less work done on app boot.

## Migrating from ember-i18n

There's an [ember-i18n-to-intl-migrator tool](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-i18n-to-intl-migrator) that is used to convert your translations files and application code to ember-intl.

If you have any questions or issues, please open in [ember-i18n-to-intl-migrator/issues](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-i18n-to-intl-migrator/issues)
